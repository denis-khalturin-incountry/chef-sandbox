{"name":"ssh_keygen","version":"1.1.0","description":"Chef resource for SSH key creation","long_description":"[![Cookbook Version](https://img.shields.io/cookbook/v/ssh_keygen.svg)](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/ssh_keygen)\n\n# ssh_keygen Chef Resource\n\nThis single-purpose cookbook provides a resource to create SSH keys, as you\nwould expect to be created with `ssh-keygen`.\n\n## Usage and Example\n\nSay you wanted to create a user (named after `test-kitchen`) and create an\nSSH key for it:\n\n```\ngroup 'kitchen' do\n  action :create\nend\n\nuser 'kitchen' do\n  action :create\n  group 'kitchen'\n  home '/home/kitchen'\n  manage_home true\nend\n\ndirectory '/home/kitchen/.ssh' do\n  action :create\nend\n\nssh_keygen '/home/kitchen/.ssh/id_rsa' do\n  action :create\n  owner 'kitchen'\n  group 'kitchen'\n  strength 4096\n  type 'rsa'\n  comment 'kitchen@localhost'\n  passphrase 'changeme'\n  secure_directory true\nend\n```\n\nThe following would (after creating the `kitchen` user), generate an SSH private\nkey in `/home/kitchen/.ssh/id_rsa`, a public key in OpenSSH format in\n`/home/kitchen/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`, and ensure the `.ssh` directory has secure\npermissions as well (so mode `0700`).\n\n### Attributes\n\nThe attributes for the `ssh_keygen` resource are:\n\n * `action`: Only `:create` is supported.\n * `path`: The path to save the SSH key to (if different from the resource name).\n * `owner`: The owner of the private and public key files.\n * `group`: The group ID for the private and public key files.\n * `strength`: Only `2048` and `4096` are supported currently, default is `2048`.\n * `type`: Only `rsa` is supported currently.\n   Ed25519 may be supported in future versions (feature request welcome!)\n * `comment`: Comment for the public key. Defaults to `user@host`.\n * `passphrase`: Passphrase for an encrypted private key. The default is no passphrase.\n * `secure_directory`: Sets the directory the key is saved in to mode to `0700`.\n\n## Author and License\n\n```\nCopyright 2015 Chris Marchesi\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n   http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n```\n","maintainer":"Chris Marchesi","maintainer_email":"chrism@vancluevertech.com","license":"Apache 2.0","platforms":{},"dependencies":{"poise":"~> 2.0"},"recommendations":{},"suggestions":{},"conflicting":{},"providing":{},"replacing":{},"attributes":{},"groupings":{},"recipes":{}}
